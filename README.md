I have major trust issues, BPD, severe loneliness, emotional detachment issues, and bipolar mood swings. I sometimes suddenly fall into a depressive episode and tend to distance myself a lot from people I know and even unfriend them, so I try to keep myself from friending others. I also hate making friends because I'm very used to being independent, and it's difficult for me to trust people.

Please don't interact with me too much. If you try to start a long conversation with me, it can make me overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

I frequently enjoy cuddles; they bring me a bit of comfort.  (I'll never approach anyone for cuddles because I'm always afraid they'll run away or judge me.)
