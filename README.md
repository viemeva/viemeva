(𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐝𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐠𝐚𝐫𝐬. 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐦𝐞 𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤.)

I have major trust issues, BPD, severe loneliness, emotional detachment issues, and bipolar mood swings. I sometimes suddenly fall into a depressive episode and tend to distance myself a lot from people I know and even unfriend them, so I try to keep myself from friending others. I also hate making friends because I'm very used to being independent, and it's difficult for me to trust people.

Please don't interact with me too much. If you try to start a long conversation with me, it can make me overwhelmed and uncomfortable.

I frequently enjoy cuddles; they bring me a bit of comfort.  (I'll never approach anyone for cuddles because I'm always afraid they'll run away or judge me.)

I sometimes have Touch Discomfort and/or Crowd/Cover Discomfort. Please respect my discomforts... Don't be an asshole and start rapidly booping me or covering me. (I find booping as an offensive gesture whenever I'm in a bad mood)
